## General Guidelines
- After you clone the repository run `mvn clean install`.
- When working on a feature we will create a new branch `name/feature-#`. e.g. `pablo/validate-input-0`.
- Every public method needs to have automated tests (unit tests). We will use `JUnit`.
- Every class and method (public or priver) needs to have a Javadoc.
